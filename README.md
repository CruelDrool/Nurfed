# Nurfed
The addon made popular by Tivoli from the guild by the same name.

# Background story
Tivoli stopped making updates to the addon many years ago. However, a fellow that went by the name Apoco did continue for some time. Eventually the whole project was discontinued all the together. For some time I was making local changes to the original addon, but decided to try and rewrite the whole thing and add new features, etc. That was in late September, 2012. However, it was done without any version control; something I have been postponing ever since. Now the the whole thing is publically available for everyone's viewing pleasure (or displeasure).

# Further development
This whole project is somewhat of an on and off thing, so the likelihood of it getting a release version is low. I just do it for fun and to challenge myself a bit. I do, however, use this addon on a daily basis so I do try to fix any bugs I come across.
