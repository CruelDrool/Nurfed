# Nurfed
The addon made popular by Tivoli from the guild by the same name.

# Background story
Tivoli stopped making updates to the addon many years ago. However, a fellow that went by the name Apoco did continue for some time. Eventually the whole project was discontinued all the together. For some time I was making local changes to the original addon, but decided to try and rewrite the whole thing and add new features, etc. That was a few years ago. What is commited as of 20th of February, 2016, is as far as I've come before finally deciding to is time to use some sort of version control.

# Further development
It's unlikely I will ever be done; this whole project is somewhat of an on and off thing. I just do it for fun and to challenge myself a bit. I do, however, use this addon on a daily basis so I do try to fix any bugs I come across.
